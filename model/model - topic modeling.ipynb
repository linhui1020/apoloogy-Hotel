As it relates to the questions regarding rate, we adhere to an industry leading best available rate program by booking direct with our hotel website.

Thank you also for making us aware of your concern regarding the elevators during your recent visit. The elevators are designed to respond to the door hold button open button for an extended period or to respond to motion.

That is not the norm.We do offer a complimentary continental breakfast each day (most hotels do not) and 24 hour fresh ground Starbucks coffee and Lipton tea each day in our 4th floor lounge. The machine is rather large and not feasible to have one in each room thus the centralized location. We understand the lounge is rather small with limited seating but provide the fresh fruit, juices. muffins, pastries and bagels with cream cheese on a complimentary basis as we think our guests appreciate the extra value we offer. We know it is far from perfect but are just trying to offer a better value and guests can always take the food back to their rooms with the trays we provide or out with them when going on their day.We were a bit confused by your comment about parking as the hotel does not pay or ever offered to pay for parking at any time. Parking is in a public lot 1 block from the hotel and we are actually able to get our guests a discounted rate of $35 when it would normally cost $50 so it is a 30% savings.Again, our sincere apologies for not meeting your expectations as your experience was not typical and we hope you would be willing to give us another chance.

As for the damp towels, I have checked with our housekeeping department to make sure that never occurs again. We do hope that you enjoyed your sightseeing in NYC and had a safe return home.Best wishes,Judite',\n",

Our hotel building, built in the 1920s does have that old-timey architecture on most of our floors, leading to some very cozy-sized rooms. With that struggle that we have here at the Courtyard Boston Downtown, we do our best to boast the beautiful spaces accessible to all of our guests, including our 15th floor lounge space with complimentary water, our Elk's Room located right by the main entrance to our lobby, and our 5th floor event areas.While we do encourage these spaces, I can still understand how our cozy rooms do not appeal to everyone. I do hope that we can have the chance to impress you in the future, there are other rooms in our hotel that would have some more space to your liking. If you are not opposed to a room with 2 beds, we have wonderful corner rooms with more space, and we also have our 15th floor executive level, where all of the rooms are of a more recent construction than the 1920s rooms that we have on the floors below it. The next time you would like to stay in Boston, please consider us again and I will be happy to give you a complementary upgrade to one of these rooms. Just reach out to me whenever you book with us next.With Warm Regards,Cristina M\",\n",

It is a fact that when there is damage in the room, a recovery fee is charged. In the case mentioned, it is our responsibility to properly sanitize the mattress in respect to all our future guests that will eventually occupy that room. Besides the cost of the cleaning of the mattress, the room will remain out of service until it is suitable for use again.

I\\'m glad you were able to get such a great deal with our recent Groupon promotion! It\\'s true that the demand in Seattle has made those lower prices hard to come by. Too many people have realized Seattle is such a great place to visit! I can confidently say that we always shop our competitors to stay affordable, but \"affordable\" in July is just nowhere near \"affordable\" in December or January.We were purpose-built from the ground up back in 2001, and regularly \"shop\" around our competitors to see what needs to change, while staying simple and comfortable. I hope you found everything you needed in the room!I\\'m very sorry you were as irritated as you were by the ventilation system in the bathroom. The machinery on the roof essentially pulls air up to ventilate the bathrooms, and on floors 2-6 it can\\'t be controlled. I imagine (though I\\'m not certain) you were on the sixth floor. Not everyone is bothered by the white noise, and I wish we had known to have offered you a room on a lower floor.

We are working on installing brand new air conditioning and heating units so hopefully this will help if you decide to give us another try in the future. And yes we do have bottled water in the minibar for purchase but of course if any of our guests are experiencing an issue such as you had; we will certainly do everything possible to remedy the situation without an added expense. We do have a wonderful ocean breeze here in Santa Monica, and that can leave a scent that some adore and some may not, which is why we have the option of an atomizer in the room, I am sorry that yours did not seem to work but again a quick call to alert our helpful and friendly staff and we would replace that right away as we have plenty of extra on hand.We do have some adjoining rooms with connecting doors and those doors are locked at all times and can only be opened by a front desk agent with a key, no guest can ever open those doors, I understand your concern with this but I can assure you they are completely safe and secure.And I am glad you received our wonderful welcome note that lets guests know about some of the wonderful features and amenities that we provide here at Palihouse and as you mentioned we do have some idiosyncrasies, being a historical landmark building we feel as most of our guests do that it only adds to the charm, it in no way indicates that we are here to give anything less than the best service possible when a guest calls the desk for assistance. I am really sorry to hear that you did not reach out to us with these concerns during your stay and allowed us the opportunity to address these issues for you to assure you had a wonderful experience, that being said I hope I was able to address your concerns and I do hope you will consider giving us another try if decide to visit beautiful Santa Monica again.Best,Greg Shortt | Housemaster',\n",

We also offer Dinner service from 1212 restaurant in Santa Monica. Additionally we offer our hotel guests a free continental breakfast served in the lobby on Saturdays and Sundays, which our guests just love and of course room service, so we do have a lot of dining options.

As you can see from all of our 5 star reviews your experience is highly unusual, perhaps the allergies were trigged by an outside side source of vegetation which would be more understandable.

In our effort to create an affordable luxury experience, The Inn @ St. Botolph has limited certain services such as the availability of a valet and parking.

We realize that you had difficulty and will be more than happy to cover the cost of your parking ticket if you provide us with a receipt.Each room at The Inn @ St. Botolph is unique, and most are equipped with bathroom shelf space. Unfortunately the delivery of the shower shelving was delayed until after our opening, so guests staying in early November did not have the opportunity to use them. In response to your other suggestions, we are currently working with our designer to provide additional shelf space near the bathroom sink and are completing an in-room directory which will clearly explain how to use our free hard-wired and wireless internet along with a quick reference for trouble shooting.We will soon expand our pillow selection and begin including complimentary coffee packets in each room for those guests who do not wish to avail themselves of the coffee, espresso and cappuccino offered with continental breakfast daily in our lounge. The elevator ring has already been addressed and the in room safes have instructions so guests can utilize them with ease.Lastly and most significantly, there is no excuse for making a guest feel uncomfortable under any circumstance. There is no other remedy than to upgrade our service standards and reinvigorate our staff. Trust that each member of our small but dedicated staff has seen your comments and has been reminded of the role they play in guaranteeing the comfort of our guests.I hope that you will take my assurances to heart and will consider returning to The Inn @ St. Botolph.Kindest Regards,Keith BeardsleyDirector of Operations',\n",
